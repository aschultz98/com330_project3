      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi!  I'm Andy Schultz, a 4th year Computer Science student at Illinois
        Tech.  I also work part-time at a neighborhood grocery store on the
        Northwest side of Chicago.

      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        This website is my landing board, an extension of my resume that will
        provide a bit more information about who I am and what I do.  It's also
        a part of my resume!  I had a few goals in mind while creating it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Showcase who I am and what I do.</li>
        <li>Utilize modern web design principles.</li>
        <li>Make sure the first two bulletpoints look nice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Student</h2>
      <p>
        High School was at <a href="https://www.nddons.org/s/1034/16/start.aspx">Notre Dame College Prep</a>.  It's an all-male school in
        Niles, Illinois.  While taking an Economics class there, I learned about
         a bit about personal finance and decided to start my college career at
        Wilbur Wright College.  It's one of the seven Chicago community colleges.
        My goal there was to transfer into Illinois Tech, and here I am.

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I've been a gamer most of my life, and Minecraft particularly caught my
        interest.  It was through this game that I had my introduction to text
        editors when I wanted to set up servers and mods for the game with my
        friends.  That led to me taking a couple of introductory programming
        classes in high school, which prompted a major in Computer Science.
        Computer Science remains as my primary interest, and Software
        Engineering is what I would like to pursure a career in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sports, video games, and healthy living are some of the things I enjoy
        outside of computers.  The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs">Cubs</a> are my baseball team and it's amazing now that
        they're competitive again.  I golf but am quite bad, and I
        still enjoy playing video games.
